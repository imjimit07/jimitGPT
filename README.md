# Make your own LLM (Large Language Models) with Python

I wrote this code to make my very own LLM. Due to its large size I couldn't upload it to github.

## Why I made this?

In 2022, I made a jupyter notebook that can act just like ChatGPT, but also the user can change the length and depth of the output. Today, I had a bold idea of making my own LLM thinking that I don't have to rely on commercial LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.

## Future
Will I continue making this better?

The answer is **NO**. A **big** no.

Making this model took a lot of time. From watching tutorials on youtube to reading the research papers given below to understand the concept of making LLMs. The time taken to find a good dataset, train the model, the math involved, amount of time it takes to finetune the model is a lot. This project was very time-consuming for me.

**Plus I don't have a GPU** that can help make the project faster.

Even after spending hours to train the model, the output I get on giving a prompt is gibberish, proving that finetuning the model will take a lot of time.
